Code Description
This is a Rust program that searches for a directory on the user's desktop and opens it in Visual Studio Code. It uses the walkdir and winreg crates to search for the directory and the std::process module to launch Visual Studio Code.

Instructions
To run the program, you need to have Rust and Visual Studio Code installed on your system.

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository.
Run cargo build --release to build the project with optimizations.
Run ./target/release/your-binary-name <directory-name> to search for the directory on your desktop and open it in Visual Studio Code.
Replace "your-binary-name" with the actual name of your binary.
Replace "<directory-name>" with the name of the directory you want to search for on your desktop.
Note:
The program expects Visual Studio Code to be installed at a specific location, which is defined by the VSCODE_LOCATION constant in the code. If Visual Studio Code is installed in a different location on your system, you need to update the constant with the correct path.

You can also install the program globally on your system by running cargo install --path . in the root directory of the repository. Once installed, you can run the program from any directory by typing your-binary-name <directory-name> in the terminal.
